In this work, basic feature selection, vectorization and deep learning techniques are used to analyze and forecast the direction of stock price. We have taken past eight years dataset Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) as news articles. Also, the datasets of five companies from different sectors have been collected along with the google trends. The data set is divided into training as well test data set. Then the basic feature processing and vectorization technique is applied to convert the news into a word vector form. This frequency word vectors are used in deep learning to improve the accuracy of model.
This work uses deep learning methods for intraday directional movement prediction of five different companies using financial news headlines and a set of technical indicators as input along with the google trends.
We have used two different word embedding techniques namely TF â€“ IDF and Word2Vec and then compared their results.
